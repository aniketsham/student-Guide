          <h2 style="font:bold;">Science </h2>

          <p>
            Science  is typically divided into three major branches,that consist of the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies;
             and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which deal with symbols governed by rules. There is disagreement,however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence.
             Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, are described as applied sciences.
